            Hello, my name is Quinn Badgett. I am from the neighboring Pike County, commuting to class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I have taken 2 previous coding classes, one for python and another for lua. I like working on old electronics, specifically TVs and computers, and I like working on cars. I most often use my computers for homework and videogames, however i also use them occasionally to code small interest projects in scripting languages like batch. I like scripting languages very much because of their simple syntax and the inherent challenge of making a program from scripting commands. I have also previously made a few websites to learn basic HTML and hosted them on Github's free website hosting service.
